Sample visualization for forecasted General Fund Revenue and Expenditure 

These visualizations were created for an assignment, with mock data provided.   
Here I have updated the data to reflect the (rounded) numbers provided in Santa Barbara County's 
Five Year Forecast & Fiscal Issue Report (https://www.countyofsb.org/ceo/asset.c/4337). 
The numbers in the report are rounded and not all relevant figures are reported, thus visualizations here should be viewed as approximations and proof of concept rather than 
as accurate representations of the Santa Barbara County 5 year forecast
