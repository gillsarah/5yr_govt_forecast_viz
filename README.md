Sample visualization for forecasted General Fund Revenue and Expenditure 

These visualizations were created for an assignment, with mock data provided.   
Here I have updated the data to reflect the (rounded) numbers provided in Santa Barbara Countiesâ€™ 
Five Year Forecast & Fiscal Issue Report (https://www.countyofsb.org/ceo/asset.c/4337). 
These numbers in the report are rounded, thus visualizations here should be viewed as approximations rather than 
as an accurate representations of the Santa Barbara County 5 year forecast
